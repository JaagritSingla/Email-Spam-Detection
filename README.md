We all receive a lot of emails in our daily life. Some emails are also very meaningless and irrelevant. We call such emails "spam". So, would you like to know which e-mail is spam and which is ham?
Dataset consist of two classes. These are "ham" and "spam".I have 4825 ham data and 747 spam data. The dataset is heavily unbalanced.
I have trained the data set with the machine learning algorithms.
  Naive Bayes
  Support Vector Machine
  KNN
  Decision Tree
  Random Forest
